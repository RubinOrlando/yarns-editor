# yarns-editor
A software MIDI editor for Mutable Insturments Yarns

## Usage:
Usage is simple:

1. Connect Yarns to a MIDI interface on your computer.
2. Set Yarns to use a remote control channel ("RC" on the panel).
3. Run Yarns Editor, and choose the same RC channel that Yarns is set to.
4. Point and click your way to victory! 

## Features:
* Yarns is deep, and editing complex layouts via the encoder can be cumbersome.  This program makes editing Yarns a snap!
* Open source! Free! 
* Multiplatorm! Works on Windows, Mac, AND Linux!
* Randomize anything! Generate complex arpeggios and Euclidean patterns with the click of a button!
* Prolong your encoder lifespan! Combined, there are over 1,000 potential values for EACH part, and Yarns has up to four parts. This program saves your encoder from a ton of clicking and spinning.
